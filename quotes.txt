My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating. Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me. 'Til then, I walk alone.
Dear Felicity, Here it goes. I watched you for four years, always wondered what you were like, and what was going on in your mind all that time when you were so quiet, just thinking. Drawing in your notebook. I should've just asked you, but I never asked you. So now, four years later, I don't even know you. But I admire you. Well, that makes me sound crazy, but I'm okay with that. So take care of yourself. Love, Ben.
I'm often reminded of the long nights I was subjected to when I had a crush on a girl from a different region of my country. Anxious and excruciating days followed by tearful merciless nights, I would try to understand why I was treated badly. Although I may be unreliable having my own biases and being a participant in what happened between us I still believe that it was an experience that has taught me a lot. I hope she has a good life and I hope she won't cause anymore long sleepless nights.
